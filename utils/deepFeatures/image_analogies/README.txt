ia_driver : runs all the other drivers

ia_driver_simple : A and B are the same image, I encourage you to
                   develop your code with this as a starting point
ia_driver_blur : runs the blur example
ia_driver_emboss : runs the embossing example
ia_driver_numbers : runs a paint-by-numbers example (this one is harder 
                    because it requires you to use three color channels)
